  * http://localhost:3000/deleteUser 
       * Method : POST
       * This API is use to delete all customer from database 
       * The role of the user should be admin

   * http://localhost:3000/balanced 
       * Method: POST 
       * This API is work only when the user is login when the user will call this API
        with JWT token then he/his performe this action 
       * As per the data structure of balanced or unbalanced string of parenthesis i used stack 
         to maintain the stack of the string 
       * Algorithm: 
            * Store opening anf closing braces into two separeted array
            * Read the string from left to right 
            * Read character from closingBraces array from current character index if exist then 
            * if stack is empty then return false its means the string is not balanced 
            * if stack is not empty then pop one element's from stack and check it on openingBraces 
              array with closingBaces index if the pop-ed character and openingBraces is not same 
              then return the string is not balanced 
            * if not character is not exist then push to stack 
            * continue this process until to reach end of the string    
           
            * When string is empty then check if stack is alos empty then return true 
              else return false

 Code Explanation : 
 
 * Middleware 
    * The purpose to add middleware here is to check if the user is passing JWT token or not 
      Before calling API 
    * If user passing JWT token then we assign the user is defined 
    * If user does not passing the JWT token the we assign the user is undefined

 * Routes: 
    * Check this links https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Oq-mtwhjhXxbd0PIFcRtO_klAYhsBE7A/view?usp=drivesdk
      for more information 
    * As you can see there is one function is called on most of API routes which is userHandlers.loginRequired 
      the purpose to user this function is that we want to disallow customer to access these API 
      directly these API is only and only access by the user if the user is login
